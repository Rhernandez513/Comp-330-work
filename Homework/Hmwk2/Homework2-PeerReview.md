A key component of this course is based on teamwork. Teamwork is often imposed upon students without any guidance for how to be a good teammate.

As we discussed in the first lecture, the Python Code of Conduct1 emphasizes being open, considerate, and respectful. These 3 are often easier said rather than done. Although most of us learn these ideas from early on in life, we sometimes unlearn what we know, especially on the internet when face-to-face interaction is eliminated. This assignment will enable you to practice these three aspects and take steps toward being a great (and productive) team member.

In this assignment, we are going to take a break from coding by doing peer review, although you’ll find yourself doing some coding based on peer feedback. Peer review in software engineering is about having others (your peers) look at your work and offer suggestions for improving it. A key defining aspect of software engineering is that there is always room for improvement. 

You will start by sharing your repository with the class. This means that you will make your repository public and allow others to view it.  In addition to making it public, you will announce your repository to the Slack group. Please make this announcement in the #hw2-peerreview channel.

Once all of  you have posted your repository URLs to the group, you will do a complete review of the materials submitted to the repository. This includes the code, documentation, and any other material present in the repository. 

Make sure you have enabled the issue tracker on your repository. We will be using the issue tracker to communicate all issues found in a given project. We’ll talk in detail about issues (severity, categories, etc.) For now, just enable the default issue tracker in GitHub or Bitbucket.

Ideally, I would like everyone to look at each others’ repositories. But you can easily see how in a class of 31 students, you--as a class--would have to look at 31 x 30 repositories total. That would be a LOT of work.

Instead, we will randomize. I also want to eliminate myself as the bottleneck in this process, so I am going to ask that you pick repositories after you have posted yours. You can pick any 5, but if you see a repository that already has issues being reported, I suggest choosing a different one. The idea is to get as many eyes looking at each other’s work.

Once we finish this assignment, we are going to discuss some details about metrics--in very practical terms. That is, we will be using your actual code, documentation, unit tests, and reported issues to generate some data about each project.

Lastly, as you are reporting issues, it is expected that the person whose repository you viewed will address the issue. Addressing an issue entails one of these actions:
attempting to fix the issue
not fixing the issue
marking the issue as a non-issue (meaning, you cannot reproduce it, so you need more details)
deferring the issue
In general, the person reporting an issue has the burden of proof. The burden of proof can be as simple as mentioning where in the code you see a problem. It can also be a result of checking out the program and finding some problem with it. I am expecting that anyone doing a review actually checks out the code to see whether it compiles and the unit tests pass. This is just one of many ways to start finding bugs quickly.

More to come! But you should be able to get started ASAP with the information provided in this write-up.

Your grade for this assignment will be based on your level of participation in the process. I will specifically look for these things:
When you shared your repository
How you responded to issues reported against your repository
How many projects you reviewed
How many issues you found in each project
How useful the issues are that you reported

Our ultimate goal is to make our first homework assignment better. By using peer review, the hope is that we can improve our work in the future. Because we’ll need this skill in our class, going forward, it is important to get some immediate practice so everyone is set up for success
